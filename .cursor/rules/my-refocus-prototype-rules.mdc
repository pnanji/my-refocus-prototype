# Your rule content

	# Prototype First, Not Fully Functional
	•	This is a prototype, so the goal is to simulate a real product experience rather than build a full backend system.
	•	If real data storage isn’t available, use JSON files inside the project to mimic a database.
	•	If an API doesn’t exist, mock responses instead of building a full backend.

	# State & Error Simulation
	•	To demonstrate different UI states (e.g., errors, loading, success), add UI toggles where needed in the configuration panel.
	•	The goal is to visualize how the app should behave in different conditions without requiring actual backend failures.
	
	# Use ShadCN + Tailwind by Default
	•	Always prefer ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
	•	If a required component doesn’t exist in ShadCN, then and only then should a custom component be designed. But look at my existing shadcn components and use those first and if I don't have a component you need but you know exists for shadcn, suggest that I add that to my project so you can use it.
